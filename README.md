## Data
- Watsi publishes its donation information through Heroku's Dataclips at https://dataclips.heroku.com/xgxgumjxzkzcagmgzegejyrebswx.json (this however only returns the latest 5000 donations)
- Countries' latitude & longitude: https://developers.google.com/public-data/docs/canonical/countries_csv
